#bionoation
#bionoation is a sorting algorithm
# write o(1) program
#write o(n) program
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i])

#we can calculate space complexity time complexity
# o(n**2)
# o(nlogn) #less time
# o(n)
# o(1)

#in time complexity we consider fastest growing term
#constants will be dropped
